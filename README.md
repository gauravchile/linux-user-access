> All main scripts (`user_setup.sh` and `test_permissions.sh`) are **outside `docs/`** for easy execution.

## 🖼️ Docs / Screenshots

- `user_setup.sh.PNG` – Shows users being created  
- `test_setup.sh.PNG` – Shows directories and permissions setup  
- `access_test_full.log` – Generated after running `test_permissions.sh`

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Make the scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x user_setup.sh
chmod +x test_permissions.sh
```

2. Run the user setup script to create users and directories:

```bash
sudo ./user_setup.sh
```

3. Run the automated access test:

```bash
sudo ./test_permissions.sh
```

4. Check the log file for results:

```
docs/access_test_full.log
```

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated

- Linux **user and group management**  
- Directory permissions and **access control**  
- Bash scripting for automation  
- Logging and testing **role-based access**  

---

## 💡 Tips

- Customize roles or directories in `user_setup.sh` for different lab setups  
- Use `cat docs/access_test_full.log` to review results quickly  
- Can be extended to **ACL testing or sudo privilege checks**
